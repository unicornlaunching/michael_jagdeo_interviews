I will. Yeah. Genius. Genius. Uh, so thank you so much for coming on the show. How can our listeners more about you? Um, you know what? If the vibes are right, you'll find me. I'm out there. So, I think I I do think that uh the West is still far more innovative than than than um than China, but man, it's it's like so hard to to go go into the future and try to figure out like what does that mean? Is it neo feudalism? Is it just uh like a middle class with superpowers? Is it the sort of US spirit of the con constitution like farmer type of guy? Yeah, go for it. So, um, I think about Roman Carthage. So, when Rome encountered Carthage and vice versa, Rome didn't have a navy. Interesting. Right. Yeah. And yet, we know about Rome and we don't really have Carthage with us today, although it exists in New York. And if you look at how Rome conquered Carthage, it's by co-opting their innovation of boats of ships of the ships. Yes. And so Peter Teal, they asked Peter Teal about this on Uncommon Knowledge and he said the US is still ahead of China in terms of innovation. We used to be ahead 10 steps. Now we're only ahead two or three. And when you're only ahead by two or three steps, that's not the same scenario as your work. And so one of the other uh futures I see is not necessarily a changing of the guard. So I think I I do think that uh the West is still far more innovative than than than um than China. Um but um if you're only one or two steps ahead, that's not very much. And so if things are copied very quickly then maybe you don't need to innovate at all. You can um outsource all the very hard R&D work to um to the west. You have a lot of dead weight economic costs associated with that. And then if you can just steal all the IP it might that might even be you know a more efficient way to um to um innovate and you're maybe you're six months behind but um you don't have to be behind that far. For Budrear the apocalypse has already occurred. The apocalypse didn't come about because of a pandemic or a nuclear war. The apocalypse happened because humans ceased to be the sole reason of things and the machines took on a reasoning of their own. And so every time I work with AI, I feel like a traitor to Connor. Right. So Connor is doing chin-ups, you know, down the hall trying to prevent AI, you know, I'm over here. Hey, you want to clone yourself? Yeah. You know, I I think about it, but I also think about that that spec specific sci-fi popularity from the 60s to the 90s was a reaction to nuclear power. Uh, and you know, Godzilla. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Godzilla. Interesting. I haven't thought about Godzilla in that. I think Godzilla is is supposed to be nuclear war. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Radiation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For Bodriard, the apocalypse has already occurred. It wasn't religious or anything. It was not atomic bombs. At some point in the development of technology, human beings ceased to be the reason of things and things took on their own reasons, technological things. I'm also reading a book. Uh, it's called The Money Market by William Behot. Wow. Okay, I got to write that down. The money Oh, man. Karma Coverage gave me this book from Dark Labs. It's The Money Market by William Behot. It's written maybe 150 years ago and it describes how the London money market came to rule European finance and it's about how by becoming experts at lending large sums of capital large sums that weren't available in industrializing economies, right? that they could take that they were the only place a country could come to to build a railway for example because in the countries they didn't have enough coordination or consensus around how capital is loaned out and so everyone had to come to London because they knew that they could get their debt priced you know New York just had their election Yeah. Oh, interesting. Yeah. And um one of the things about New York is they kind of got the short end of the stick of the Donald Trump Inquisition. Go explain that. What is I don't I'm not familiar there. Sure. So, like it's the New York attorney general that wanted to prosecute Donald Trump, right? So if you look at the relationship between the current administration, New York strain ties. Now the other thing you're going to like uh the ascent of money, the money market. Have you ever heard of the TXS? No. You're going to like this. TXSE is the Texas Stock Exchange. I didn't hear about this. Yeah. Interesting. that it's a joint venture between Citadel and Black Rockck about a buck 25 125 million about a couple years ago very quietly it's in the news but you know very quietly they said all right you know what my my pet theory is that the uh wealth from the the southern states want a bit more control over the political legal and regulatory environment of their equity debt positions. Well, what do I want to know? Uh uh so okay, so the wealth the the the stories because it's almost like a a return of of the south uh after 150 years. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh which I kind of like uh not so Mexico the south is trying to take uh control of the north again. I chaos always seems to just uh wipe the board clean. Uh, and people who think they have a lot of power essentially lose a lot of power as well. Any thoughts there? So, I think of two things. I had to write them down. Um, I think about paper clips and I think about um the theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism. Oo, interesting. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So um the theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism uh is a book hidden within 1984. Oh great. Right. And so by Goldstein, Emanuel Goldstein and he says he basically pauses that the nature of most industries is consolidation. When uh beer, diamonds, you uranium, you name it. Um as industries mature, money markets, food even, right? Um these to be efficient, a market consolidates, and large players emerge, right? And so part of me feels that if it is true that the nature as civilizations mature is that their industries oligarchize right where there's natural oligopul that's almost driven by economies of scale then if it's true that a cottage industry will naturally emerge no matter where you are um then conspiracies are likely to ensue from that and those will be true because once you have a cottage industry monopoly right yes exactly a a co- monopoly a syndicate a shosa a caretsu mitsubishi three diamonds three industries right syndicates form uh as a result of a stone soup they can't have a meal without adding ingredients together. They can't make a meal alone. Entropy, native entropy. Interesting. Yeah. And the nature to further drive profits. And so I when I mentioned the paper clips, I think that you know the criticism of AI and any computer kind of uh driven system is that eventually it'll allocate all resources against human desires. Oh, right. And so when I look at these oligarchies and these civilizations, um the way that civilizations expand is by turning other nations into their paper clip makers to give leisure to their population. Well, okay. Well, that yes, so in the industrial age, leisure to the bgeoisi and the proletariat. Um uh now we seem to be into another strange place of history where it seems to be messing up. Yeah, go for it. I would love to hear what you think. But the burgeois, everyone in North America is the burgeois compared to the rest of the world. Y right. And I don't think the part that I still wrestle with in my mind is that um you know leisure comes out of imperial conquest in that way, right? the the American leisure system AC and the internet and all is only a factor of their power of the oligarchic system. Yeah. And the fact that everyone was rebuilding for the past hundred years while we were proliferating. Yeah. Interesting. This is uh very interesting territory. So the leisure because because it is the aristocracy and we're going into neofudalism. Do well actually a good question for you. Do you think that the middle class is on its way out? Do you think the middle class is going to survive this? What do you think? Um, I think everything we're experiencing from a technology perspective has the ability to achieve both the 10,000 beautiful visions and the 10,000 horrible visions. Yeah, I agree. And so the more I see the power of technology, I'm like, wow, do you realize the power of a single individual? Yep. And that's and this government is saying, oh shit, did you see the power of the single individual? Right. Yeah. You know, I think the because they've been playing out an opportunity for a liquidity exit. That's Bitcoin. That's where Bitcoin comes in. Well, there is no Bitcoin without inflation. Yeah. Right. And so, uh, at the same time, uh, when is an exit simply another trap? A lot of a lot of my friends call Bitcoin quantitative decentralization. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Digital currency doesn't just allow for decentralization. If you look at the theory of oligarchical collectivism and the natural cottage monopolies or industries or oligopodies or soosas that emerge, a lot of people are looking at the consolidation in the market and saying Bitcoin might be the source and acceleration of a neoalism. Yep. Yep. And I can see that argument. Yep. It's only volatile if you watch it every day. 7 billion 7 trillion. A trillion for Vangar. Yeah. He um wrote a thesis at Princeton in the 50s. Wow. On the fact that a lot of these hedge funds were lying to people and masquerading their ability to produce returns that only make money for them. Yeah. And so he wrote the index thesis called the index fund and Vanguard hired him, implemented the thesis and literally made $7 trillion by knowing that they could not time the market which is what they what they say in finance they or the finance classes. My friend used to tell me that that's what he learned is like information asymmetry. Uh you just unless you're an insider you don't have the information to make the short-term trades. There's all these like arbitrage quantitative things that you can do with a computer. But it turns out that the only way these really fancy people can outperform the market is by transferring their losses onto the taxpayers during a bailout. The socialization of risk uh which is the whole reason our this was just so crazy that 2008 happened. Uh, I've been in the ascent of money. Continues to happen. It continues to happen. There's no there's no there's no one went to jail in 2008. Uh, look what happened with Robin Hood. Robin Hood to me was like a soft bailout because it prevented people from going belly up during GameStop. They halted trading. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. And I was like, whoa, they're now doing micro bailouts. This is nuts. Because I think capitalism and communism have done a good job for the population on planet Earth as balancing forces. Oh, interesting. Right. Collectivism and individualism working together side by side, you know. Um, and so, you know, if you look at the operating system of the west, it does drive innovation. Yeah. If you look at the operating system of the east right it drives um uh commercializ in terms of like industrial commercialization let's say right and so if we can maintain that balance that would be great but whether AI is a at present a symbiate but in the long run a parasite I can see those futures. Mhm. When when does the parasite become the host? Oh, so I was just thinking about this as I uh recklessly uh put cloud code on my computer. I already did cloud on my computer a while ago. Awesome. Yeah. uh cloud code and cloud desktop uh on my computer and I try to limit it but you know given this um the what claude an enthropic released and I think chat openai also released something similar about their papers of so if you look at what's happening with Jim Keller and his startup tens torrent Jim Keller built everyone ships cool ke l e r look him up what's his name ten Torrent. Okay. And so AMD, Intel, Tesla, Apple, that's Jim Keller's chips. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. He started his own company. Yeah. When he had a disagreement with the guy who's no longer there at Intel, right? Wow. And so he started his own company and they're uh to the individual power side. Uh Nvidia has a strangle hold uh on the market through their CUDA environment for programming. Yeah. Which Jim and everyone at R R Ic5 Risk 5 which is the idea of open- source hardware. Nice. Okay. Right. Yeah. Is to completely and that's same thing with Mojo. They want to disrupt the Nvidia Jensen hegemony. And so this is where I see again those shifting powers because the scale is coming to the edge, that power that used to just be um monopolized is coming to the edge. And if you look at exponential organizations that are achieving billion dollar valuations with less than 12 disciples, right, you don't need that many people to agree with you to make a big impact. Yeah. Look at clearly. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Okay. Exponential organizations. Uh do you know are there books there about Yes. Yeah. So, um, you ever heard of Price's law? No. Price's law, it's a kind of it's the idea that basically fuels recruiting. The square root of the number of people in an industry do 50% of the work, right? Now there's debates about whether it's accurate and how much but I think we all have kind of you know an instinct that if you have 10 people in the room one person is doing most of the work or haven't you not experienced that working in small teams before right and so um exponential organizations leverages this fact by saying if it is true that the square root of the number of people in an industry do 50% of the work. Now that we have open- source hardware and AI and all of these things to operate as if we were operating at scale, then how do we achieve a billion dollar valuation with under less than 12 people? That's what exponential organizations. Okay, great. And any books that go into that specific one? Yes, there's a book by um Saleem Ishmael who was a a seasoned you know startup and venture executive. He has numerous books and you'll see an infographic that talks about the eight elements of exponential organizations. Okay, great. That's for me to go find that. Um given all those efficiencies, why doesn't one company own everything? Um and and yeah, because they treat the talent bad once they get to that size though, right? Because there's no choice not to. If it's one thing that corporations do extremely well, it's keep recruiters employed because they constantly treat the prices love people like shit. Yeah. And eventually, right, they they either I reach out to them or someone like me calls them and says, "Hi, my name is Michael. We haven't spoken before. Let me take some of the mystery out of my call." And I talk to them about an opportunity that, you know, I don't want to break up a happy home, but Yeah. You know, would you be open? Yeah. Yeah. Right. Oh, you would be. Oh, you need to close your door. I'll wait. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. I don't I've now figured out I definitely don't never want to work in an organization larger than 150 people. Um like non-starter for me. I never want to do that again. Um and thinking about my own future business and this 12 number feels like a really good number uh to to focus on. Um even 12 was too much for Jesus. Sorry. Uh let's go down that path. Uh, okay. Yeah. Even Wait, because of Judas. There's a Judas in every age. Judas. That's not me. That's Wilhelm Reich. The murder of Christ. Wilhelm Reich. Watch out for that guy cuz he had his books burned. Wilhelm Reich. The murder of Christ. What? That's the book. Okay. Christ was not crucified. He was murdered. Understand the difference. There was a Judas in every age. Oh man, I'm not a Python developer, but I can get Python code and I can copy and paste that into a box that runs it. Yeah, that runs it. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Uh uh a guy who started a nuclear company told me this story and laughed. A man is starving. He starts begging for food. Nobody gives him food. So he goes to another village and starts begging for food. Nobody gives him food. With his last energy, he goes to a third village. And this time he switches up his strategy. He finds a big cauldron, fills it with water, puts a fire underneath the cauldron, starts boiling the water. Then he finds a large stone and puts a stone at the bottom of the cauldron. By this time, a woman and her son noticed what's happening and she asked the man, "Hey, what are you doing?" And he goes, "I'm making a stone soup." And she goes, "Oh, that sounds delicious. Can I have some?" And he goes, "Sure, just add an ingredient." And one by one, everyone in the village added an ingredient. And that's how a man fed himself and saved himself some from starvation and fed the rest of the village at the same time. That's how I look at recruiting. where people have a desire to achieve things that are beyond their personal capability and if you can offer them the opportunity to combine their ingredients with others, everyone can eat. I look at religions like operating systems, right? So if you look at Greek society when they were young and less mature and more agricultural agriculturally driven they worship Hestia the goddess of the earth and Zeus but when they industrialized and imperialized Athena and Aries took over. M and so to me it's the civilization and the population that choose which god they worship the god of their own understanding which is really the god of their own incentives so they don't realize it at the time yep yep it's the same as the individual as well the individual can kind of go through a similar process in terms of what they value so comp said there are three stages uh we go through Um well we go from nature worship to polytheism to monotheism to metaphysics to science and philosophy. Mhm. And religion seldom survives philosophy challenge is art is built on the religion. So when you displace the religion with science you lose the art off of it. So where does that leave us in terms of western civilization? So if you look at the cyclical nature of things, says God is dead and Young says yes, he dies every so often or haven't you noticed? And so this whole movement towards touching grass and being one with nature is a natural move from getting fed up with the Iron Man Marvel movie and scientism to going back to nature. But then you also see the large conversion of scienceism to the Nation of Islam. We're going back to Christianity. Yeah. Right. That's why Jordan Peterson is so popular. Not because he's a great debater, but because he's bringing back the grandparents religion. Yeah. In a way that's a little more palatable. Because when you're young, it's fuck you, fuck off grandpa. Right. Yeah. What happens when Lin Linus dies and he leaves Linux? What do you think about that? Have you been uh noticing the debates in the Linux kernel email chat? So, take a look. You'll see that Linus is beefing with some of the community members right now. Yeah. about um file system upgrades to the Linux system. Um there are a lot of people who do not like what's happening in the political, legal and regulatory market on the Linux side in terms of capture in terms of what Ubuntu is doing in terms of uh these new terms of services. Do we have to start a new Linux? You are seeing people get uh a framer laptop which is a modular laptop. Framer remember they want to do modular phones. Framer did a modular desktop and a modular laptop that you can just turn over, open up and just like the Fisher Price replace the pieces as and when you like including the screen. Oo that's good. They Yeah. So it's Framer and Linux. Um, I think the the YouTuber PewDiePie is really making Linux popular right now because he said, "Oh, nice." Uh, fuck all this running Linux. And that started him down the rabbit hole of trying to repatriate all of his services and become his own self-hosted solution provider. So, brilliant. I'm definitely going to do a deep dive on that one. Um the uh who should I interview about this uh this uh new uh division with Linux Linux? Oh man. Um I would have to think I know actually an interesting interview uh would be with um Liinal Snake. Do you know Liinal Snake? I don't. Uh actually Brian was introduced to me through Liinal Snake. Okay, cool. Liinal Snake uh he wrote the forward when I wrote a book what I learned on X. He wrote the forward. I asked him to um and in the forward he writes X is a sea of narcissists and uh he told me that everyone has an epistemic center but most people never move theirs. Whoa. Moving an epistemic center. That's good. He said, "Everyone has an epistemic center. Most people never move theirs." The other thing he told me is that if God grants you the ability to turn a curse into a blessing and wander the land collecting curses, he understands Linux. And so I he's at a liinal snake.

00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,960
I will.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,639
Yeah.

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,000
Genius. Genius.

4
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,519
Uh, so thank you so much for coming on

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,919
the show. How can our listeners more

6
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:12,919
about you?

7
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:12,919
Um,

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,679
you know what? If the vibes are right,

9
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:22,719
you'll find me. I'm out there.

10
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,118
So, I think I I do think that uh the

11
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:28,479
West is still far more innovative than

12
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:31,118
than than um than China, but man, it's

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,880
it's like so hard to to go go into the

14
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,119
future and try to figure out like what

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,280
does that mean? Is it neo feudalism? Is

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:40,640
it just

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,480
uh like a middle class with superpowers?

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,719
Is it the sort of US spirit of the con

19
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:50,959
constitution like farmer type of guy?

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:53,439
Yeah, go for it. So, um, I think about

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,160
Roman Carthage.

22
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,599
So, when Rome encountered Carthage and

23
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,479
vice versa,

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,679
Rome didn't have a navy.

25
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,320
Interesting.

26
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:02,799
Right.

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,640
Yeah.

28
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:08,640
And yet, we know about Rome and we don't

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,680
really have Carthage with us today,

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,478
although it exists in New York. And if

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,720
you look at how Rome conquered Carthage,

32
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,239
it's by

33
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,079
co-opting

34
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,199
their innovation

35
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,679
of boats of ships

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,400
of the ships. Yes.

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,159
And so Peter Teal, they asked Peter Teal

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,600
about this on Uncommon Knowledge and he

39
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,400
said the US is still ahead of China in

40
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:37,280
terms of innovation. We used to be ahead

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,359
10 steps. Now we're only ahead two or

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,599
three. And when you're only ahead by two

43
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,959
or three steps, that's not the same

44
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:48,000
scenario as your work. And so one of the

45
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,639
other uh futures I see

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,680
is not necessarily a changing of the

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,359
guard.

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,200
So I think I I do think that uh the West

49
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:01,519
is still far more innovative than than

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,600
than um than China. Um but um if you're

51
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,239
only one or two steps ahead, that's not

52
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,399
very much. And so if things are copied

53
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,359
very quickly then maybe you don't need

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,719
to innovate at all. You can um outsource

55
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,959
all the very hard R&amp;D work to um to the

56
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,039
west. You have a lot of dead weight

57
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,120
economic costs associated with that. And

58
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,039
then if you can just steal all the IP it

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,680
might that might even be you know a more

60
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,439
efficient way to um to um innovate and

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,280
you're maybe you're six months behind

62
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,000
but um you don't have to be behind that

63
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,239
far.

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,039
For Budrear the apocalypse has already

65
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,759
occurred. The apocalypse

66
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,639
didn't come about because of a pandemic

67
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:44,399
or a nuclear war. The apocalypse

68
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:46,878
happened because humans ceased to be the

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,080
sole reason of things and the machines

70
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:52,000
took on a reasoning of their own.

71
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,239
And so every time I work with AI, I feel

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,080
like a traitor to

73
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,519
Connor.

74
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,319
Right. So Connor is doing chin-ups, you

75
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,599
know,

76
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,199
down the hall

77
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,119
trying to prevent AI, you know, I'm over

78
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,119
here. Hey, you want to clone yourself?

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,959
Yeah.

80
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
You know, I I think about it, but I also

81
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,840
think about that that spec specific

82
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,959
sci-fi popularity from the 60s to the

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,080
90s was a reaction to nuclear power. Uh,

84
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,039
and you know,

85
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,440
Godzilla.

86
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,878
Yeah.

87
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,079
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Godzilla. Interesting.

88
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:22,318
I haven't thought about Godzilla in

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
that.

90
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,518
I think Godzilla is is supposed to be

91
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,119
nuclear war.

92
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,640
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Radiation. Yeah. Yeah.

93
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,878
Yeah.

94
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,479
For Bodriard, the apocalypse has already

95
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,919
occurred. It wasn't religious or

96
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,518
anything. It was not atomic bombs.

97
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,280
At some point in the development of

98
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,640
technology,

99
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,519
human beings ceased to be the reason of

100
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:48,318
things and things took on their own

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:53,920
reasons, technological things.

102
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:57,679
I'm also reading a book. Uh, it's called

103
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:59,039
The Money Market by William Behot.

104
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,760
Wow. Okay, I got to write that down.

105
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,479
The money Oh, man. Karma Coverage gave

106
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:08,079
me this book from Dark Labs. It's The

107
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:11,280
Money Market by William Behot. It's

108
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,840
written maybe 150 years ago and it

109
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,360
describes

110
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,040
how

111
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,799
the London money market came

112
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,919
to rule

113
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:26,719
European finance

114
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,879
and it's about how

115
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:34,160
by becoming

116
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:37,040
experts at lending large sums of capital

117
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,639
large sums that weren't available

118
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,439
in industrializing economies,

119
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,240
right? that they could take that they

120
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:49,600
were the only place a country could come

121
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,918
to to build a railway for example

122
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,720
because in the countries they didn't

123
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:58,240
have enough coordination or consensus

124
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,759
around how capital is loaned out and so

125
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,360
everyone had to come to London because

126
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,160
they knew that they could get their debt

127
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,759
priced

128
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,960
you know New York just had their

129
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:15,520
election Yeah. Oh, interesting. Yeah.

130
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:19,359
And um one of the things about New York

131
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:22,799
is they kind of got the short end of the

132
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,479
stick of the Donald Trump Inquisition.

133
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,439
Go explain that. What is I don't I'm not

134
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:26,959
familiar there.

135
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,120
Sure. So, like

136
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:32,959
it's the New York attorney general that

137
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,000
wanted to prosecute Donald Trump,

138
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,000
right?

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,800
So if you look at the relationship

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,399
between the current administration,

141
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,720
New York strain ties. Now the other

142
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,519
thing you're going to like uh the ascent

143
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:52,280
of money, the money market.

144
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,279
Have you ever heard of the TXS?

145
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,120
No.

146
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,478
You're going to like this.

147
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,399
TXSE is the Texas

148
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,000
Stock Exchange. I didn't hear about

149
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:05,439
this. Yeah. Interesting. that it's a

150
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,319
joint venture between Citadel and Black

151
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,478
Rockck

152
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:12,639
about a buck 25 125 million about a

153
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:15,360
couple years ago very quietly it's in

154
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,879
the news but you know very quietly they

155
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:23,439
said all right you know what my my pet

156
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:26,000
theory is that the uh wealth from the

157
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,319
the southern states want a bit more

158
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,160
control over the political legal and

159
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,960
regulatory environment

160
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,520
of their equity debt positions.

161
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,038
Well, what do I want to know?

162
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,719
Uh uh so okay, so the wealth the the the

163
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,439
stories because it's almost like a a

164
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,120
return of of the south uh after 150

165
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,199
years.

166
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,199
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh which I kind of

167
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,520
like uh not

168
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,840
so Mexico the south is trying to take uh

169
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,560
control of the north again. I

170
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,318
chaos always seems to just uh wipe the

171
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,680
board clean. Uh, and people who think

172
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,840
they have a lot of power essentially

173
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,759
lose a lot of power as well. Any

174
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,758
thoughts there?

175
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,479
So, I think of two things. I had to

176
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,280
write them down. Um,

177
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:15,839
I think about paper clips and I think

178
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:18,159
about um the theory and practice of

179
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:21,359
oligarchical collectivism.

180
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,080
Oo, interesting. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So um

181
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,759
the theory and practice of oligarchical

182
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,959
collectivism

183
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,080
uh is a book hidden within 1984.

184
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,439
Oh great.

185
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,959
Right. And so by Goldstein, Emanuel

186
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:40,160
Goldstein

187
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:44,879
and he says he basically pauses that the

188
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:48,240
nature of most industries

189
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,560
is consolidation.

190
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,319
When

191
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:57,120
uh beer, diamonds,

192
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:02,000
you uranium, you name it.

193
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,439
Um as industries mature, money markets,

194
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,839
food even,

195
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,360
right? Um

196
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,959
these

197
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,598
to be efficient, a market consolidates,

198
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:18,079
and large players emerge,

199
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:20,478
right? And so part of me feels that if

200
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:23,198
it is true that the nature as

201
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:25,598
civilizations mature is that their

202
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,720
industries oligarchize

203
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:32,799
right where there's natural oligopul

204
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,240
that's almost driven by economies of

205
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,158
scale

206
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,399
then if it's true that a cottage

207
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:42,240
industry will naturally emerge no matter

208
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:46,399
where you are um then conspiracies are

209
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,039
likely to ensue from that

210
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,720
and those will be true because once you

211
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,079
have a cottage industry

212
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,800
monopoly right

213
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:59,839
yes exactly a a co- monopoly a syndicate

214
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,159
a shosa a caretsu

215
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,320
mitsubishi three diamonds

216
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:08,639
three industries

217
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,959
right syndicates form uh as a result of

218
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,759
a stone soup they can't have a meal

219
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,518
without adding ingredients together.

220
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,639
They can't make a meal alone.

221
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,200
Entropy, native entropy. Interesting.

222
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,639
Yeah.

223
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,240
And the nature to further drive profits.

224
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,360
And so I when I mentioned the paper

225
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:31,440
clips, I think that you know the

226
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:34,080
criticism of AI and any computer kind of

227
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,000
uh driven system is that eventually

228
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,519
it'll allocate all resources against

229
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,839
human desires.

230
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:46,799
Oh, right. And so when I look at these

231
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:51,760
oligarchies and these civilizations,

232
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:54,958
um the way that civilizations expand is

233
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:57,838
by turning other nations

234
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:03,039
into their paper clip makers

235
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:04,720
to give leisure to their population.

236
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,199
Well, okay. Well, that yes, so in the

237
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,920
industrial age, leisure to the bgeoisi

238
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,920
and the proletariat. Um uh now we seem

239
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,439
to be into another strange place of

240
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,479
history where it seems to be messing up.

241
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,040
Yeah, go for it. I would love to hear

242
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,120
what you think.

243
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,278
But the burgeois, everyone in North

244
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,078
America is the burgeois compared to the

245
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:21,039
rest of the world.

246
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:25,039
Y

247
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:28,480
right. And I don't think the part that I

248
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:33,679
still wrestle with in my mind is that um

249
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:36,320
you know leisure comes out of imperial

250
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:39,120
conquest in that way,

251
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,200
right? the the American leisure system

252
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,159
AC and the internet and all

253
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,640
is only a factor of their power of the

254
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,000
oligarchic system. Yeah.

255
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,159
And the fact that everyone was

256
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,799
rebuilding for the past hundred years

257
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,799
while we were proliferating.

258
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:59,838
Yeah. Interesting.

259
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,600
This is uh very interesting territory.

260
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,279
So the leisure

261
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,480
because because it is the aristocracy

262
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,759
and we're going into neofudalism.

263
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,120
Do well actually a good question for

264
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,799
you. Do you think that the middle class

265
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,879
is on its way out? Do you think the

266
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,679
middle class is going to survive this?

267
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,278
What do you think?

268
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,958
Um,

269
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,639
I think everything we're experiencing

270
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:28,479
from a technology perspective has the

271
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:30,559
ability to achieve both the 10,000

272
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,000
beautiful visions and the 10,000

273
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,278
horrible visions.

274
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,519
Yeah, I agree.

275
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,039
And so the more I see the power of

276
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,320
technology, I'm like, wow, do you

277
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,360
realize the power of a single

278
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,160
individual?

279
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,759
Yep.

280
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,360
And that's and this government is

281
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,480
saying, oh [ __ ] did you see the power

282
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,200
of the single individual?

283
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,159
Right.

284
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,360
Yeah.

285
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,399
You know, I think the

286
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,240
because they've been playing out

287
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,600
an opportunity for a liquidity exit.

288
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,720
That's Bitcoin. That's where Bitcoin

289
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,519
comes in.

290
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,800
Well, there is no Bitcoin without

291
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,200
inflation.

292
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,319
Yeah.

293
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,079
Right.

294
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,920
And so,

295
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:11,120
uh, at the same time, uh, when is an

296
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,599
exit simply another trap?

297
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,200
A lot of a lot of my friends call

298
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,720
Bitcoin quantitative decentralization.

299
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

300
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,278
Right. Digital currency doesn't just

301
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,440
allow for decentralization. If you look

302
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,000
at the theory of oligarchical

303
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,560
collectivism and the natural cottage

304
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,919
monopolies or industries or oligopodies

305
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:36,559
or soosas that emerge, a lot of people

306
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,039
are looking at the consolidation in the

307
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:41,199
market and saying

308
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,559
Bitcoin might be the source and

309
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,160
acceleration of a neoalism.

310
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,759
Yep. Yep.

311
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,799
And I can see that argument.

312
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,039
Yep.

313
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,120
It's only volatile if you watch it every

314
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,319
day. 7 billion

315
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,440
7 trillion.

316
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,879
A trillion

317
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,200
for Vangar. Yeah. He um wrote a thesis

318
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,600
at Princeton in the 50s.

319
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,079
Wow.

320
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,320
On the fact that a lot of these hedge

321
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,120
funds were lying to people

322
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,680
and masquerading their ability to

323
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,240
produce returns that only make money for

324
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,239
them.

325
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:19,839
Yeah. And so he wrote the index thesis

326
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,480
called the index fund and Vanguard hired

327
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:26,000
him, implemented the thesis and

328
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:29,440
literally made $7 trillion by knowing

329
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,958
that they could not time the market

330
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,880
which is what they what they say in

331
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,078
finance they or the finance classes. My

332
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,439
friend used to tell me that that's what

333
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,599
he learned is like information

334
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,880
asymmetry. Uh you just unless you're an

335
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,560
insider you don't have the information

336
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,240
to make the short-term trades. There's

337
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,838
all these like arbitrage quantitative

338
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,360
things that you can do with a computer.

339
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,639
But

340
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:52,159
it turns out that the only way these

341
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:56,399
really fancy people can outperform the

342
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:59,838
market is by transferring their losses

343
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,720
onto the taxpayers during a bailout.

344
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,279
The socialization of risk uh which is

345
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,920
the whole reason our this was just so

346
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,039
crazy that 2008 happened. Uh, I've been

347
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,000
in the ascent of money.

348
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:11,838
Continues to happen.

349
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,919
It continues to happen. There's no

350
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,839
there's no there's no one went to jail

351
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,919
in 2008. Uh,

352
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,240
look what happened with Robin Hood.

353
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:24,479
Robin Hood to me was like a soft bailout

354
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,879
because it prevented people from going

355
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,519
belly up during GameStop. They halted

356
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,958
trading.

357
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,278
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. And

358
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:34,719
I was like, whoa, they're now doing

359
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:37,198
micro bailouts. This is nuts. Because I

360
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,240
think capitalism and communism have done

361
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,198
a good job for the population on planet

362
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,278
Earth

363
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,399
as balancing forces.

364
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,439
Oh, interesting.

365
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,720
Right. Collectivism and individualism

366
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:55,760
working together side by side, you know.

367
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:58,560
Um, and so, you know, if you look at the

368
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,000
operating system of the west, it does

369
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,759
drive innovation.

370
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,759
Yeah. If you look at the operating

371
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:08,720
system of the east

372
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:10,879
right it drives um

373
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,680
uh commercializ in terms of like

374
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,879
industrial commercialization let's say

375
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:20,000
right and so if we can maintain that

376
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:22,480
balance that would be great but whether

377
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,278
AI is a

378
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,480
at present a symbiate but in the long

379
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:31,519
run a parasite I can see those futures.

380
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,039
Mhm. When when does the parasite become

381
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,959
the host?

382
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,719
Oh,

383
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,679
so I was just thinking about this as I

384
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,360
uh recklessly uh put cloud code on my

385
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,278
computer. I already did cloud on my

386
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,000
computer a while ago. Awesome.

387
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:49,600
Yeah. uh cloud code and cloud desktop uh

388
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,759
on my computer and I try to limit it but

389
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,920
you know given this um the what claude

390
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,759
an enthropic released and I think chat

391
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,439
openai also released something similar

392
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,600
about their papers of

393
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,040
so if you look at what's happening with

394
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,278
Jim Keller and his startup tens torrent

395
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:11,120
Jim Keller built everyone ships

396
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:12,958
cool ke l e r look him up

397
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,759
what's his name

398
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,799
ten

399
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,240
Torrent.

400
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:20,958
Okay.

401
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:23,600
And so AMD, Intel, Tesla, Apple,

402
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,559
that's Jim Keller's chips.

403
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,159
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

404
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,719
He started his own company.

405
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,198
Yeah.

406
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,199
When he had a disagreement with the guy

407
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,519
who's no longer there at Intel,

408
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,639
right?

409
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,000
Wow.

410
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,680
And so he started his own company and

411
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,600
they're

412
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:44,958
uh to the individual power side. Uh

413
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:48,240
Nvidia has a strangle hold uh on the

414
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:49,758
market through their CUDA environment

415
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
for programming.

416
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,519
Yeah.

417
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:58,399
Which Jim and everyone at R R Ic5

418
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,360
Risk 5 which is the idea of open- source

419
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,039
hardware.

420
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,000
Nice. Okay.

421
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,399
Right.

422
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,720
Yeah.

423
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,679
Is to completely and that's same thing

424
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:11,519
with Mojo. They want to disrupt the

425
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,839
Nvidia Jensen hegemony.

426
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,199
And so this is where I see again those

427
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:19,438
shifting powers

428
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,880
because the scale is coming to the edge,

429
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:25,279
that power

430
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,199
that used to just be um monopolized is

431
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,440
coming to the edge. And if you look at

432
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,000
exponential organizations that are

433
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,400
achieving billion dollar valuations with

434
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,558
less than 12 disciples,

435
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,960
right, you don't need that many people

436
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:39,359
to agree with you to make a big impact.

437
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,720
Yeah.

438
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,159
Look at clearly.

439
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,160
Yeah.

440
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,519
Yeah.

441
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,160
Yep. Okay. Exponential organizations. Uh

442
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,759
do you know are there books there about

443
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,480
Yes.

444
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:57,359
Yeah. So,

445
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,640
um, you ever heard of Price's law?

446
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:02,079
No.

447
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:06,080
Price's law, it's a kind of it's the

448
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:08,558
idea that basically fuels recruiting.

449
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:12,879
The square root of the number of people

450
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:15,200
in an industry do 50% of the work,

451
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,600
right? Now there's debates about whether

452
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,759
it's accurate and how much but I think

453
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:23,839
we all have kind of you know an instinct

454
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,160
that if you have 10 people in the room

455
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,319
one person is doing most of the work

456
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,120
or haven't you not experienced that

457
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:33,119
working in small teams before right

458
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:36,719
and so

459
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:41,918
um exponential organizations leverages

460
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,839
this fact by saying if it is true that

461
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,799
the square root of the number of people

462
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,798
in an industry do 50% of the work.

463
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,119
Now that we have open- source hardware

464
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,839
and AI and all of these things to

465
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,918
operate as if we were operating at

466
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:58,959
scale,

467
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,640
then how do we achieve a billion dollar

468
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,759
valuation

469
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,000
with under less than 12 people? That's

470
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,400
what exponential organizations.

471
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,880
Okay, great. And any books that go into

472
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,640
that specific one? Yes, there's a book

473
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,880
by um Saleem Ishmael who was a a

474
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,600
seasoned

475
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,160
you know startup and venture executive.

476
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,558
He has numerous books and you'll see an

477
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,679
infographic that talks about the eight

478
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:30,000
elements of exponential organizations.

479
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,480
Okay, great. That's for me to go find

480
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,960
that. Um given all those efficiencies,

481
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,519
why doesn't one company own everything?

482
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,480
Um and and

483
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:42,400
yeah,

484
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,839
because they treat the talent bad

485
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,798
once they get to that size though,

486
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:49,038
right? Because there's no choice not to.

487
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,279
If it's one thing that corporations do

488
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:54,319
extremely well, it's keep recruiters

489
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:56,960
employed because they constantly treat

490
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:59,038
the prices love people like [ __ ]

491
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,600
Yeah. And eventually,

492
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,319
right, they they either I reach out to

493
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,319
them or someone like me calls them and

494
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,159
says, "Hi, my name is Michael. We

495
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,519
haven't spoken before.

496
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,080
Let me take some of the mystery out of

497
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:15,038
my call."

498
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,399
And I talk to them about an opportunity

499
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:17,839
that, you know, I don't want to break up

500
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,038
a happy home, but Yeah.

501
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,240
You know, would you be open?

502
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:21,279
Yeah. Yeah.

503
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,519
Right.

504
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:27,678
Oh, you would be. Oh, you need to close

505
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:29,440
your door. I'll wait. Right.

506
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,200
Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. I don't I've

507
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,960
now figured out I definitely don't never

508
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,200
want to work in an organization larger

509
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,600
than 150 people. Um like non-starter for

510
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,640
me. I never want to do that again. Um

511
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:45,839
and thinking about my own future

512
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,480
business and this 12 number feels like a

513
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:52,079
really good number uh to to focus on. Um

514
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,120
even 12 was too much for Jesus.

515
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,399
Sorry.

516
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,839
Uh let's go down that path. Uh, okay.

517
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,080
Yeah. Even Wait, because of Judas.

518
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,839
There's a Judas in every age.

519
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,000
Judas.

520
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,359
That's not me. That's Wilhelm Reich. The

521
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,599
murder of Christ.

522
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,439
Wilhelm Reich. Watch out for that guy

523
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,038
cuz he had his books burned.

524
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,640
Wilhelm Reich.

525
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,200
The murder of Christ.

526
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,320
What?

527
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,600
That's the book.

528
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:19,519
Okay.

529
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,079
Christ was not crucified. He was

530
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:25,519
murdered. Understand the difference.

531
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:28,480
There was a Judas in every age. Oh man,

532
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm not a Python developer, but I can

533
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:37,400
get Python code and I can copy and paste

534
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,400
that into a box that runs it.

535
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,240
Yeah, that runs it. Yeah. Yeah.

536
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,639
Interesting. Uh

537
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,200
uh a guy who started a nuclear company

538
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,679
told me this story and laughed.

539
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,600
A man is starving.

540
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,480
He starts begging for food. Nobody gives

541
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,158
him food. So he goes to another village

542
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,279
and starts begging for food. Nobody

543
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,440
gives him food. With his last energy, he

544
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,759
goes to a third village. And this time

545
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,120
he switches up his strategy. He finds a

546
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:09,200
big cauldron, fills it with water,

547
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:11,839
puts a fire underneath the cauldron,

548
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,759
starts boiling the water. Then he finds

549
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,158
a large stone and puts a stone at the

550
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:19,200
bottom of the cauldron.

551
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,280
By this time, a woman and her son

552
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,720
noticed what's happening and she asked

553
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,279
the man, "Hey, what are you doing?" And

554
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,880
he goes, "I'm making a stone soup." And

555
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,639
she goes, "Oh, that sounds delicious.

556
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,200
Can I have some?" And he goes, "Sure,

557
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,440
just add an ingredient."

558
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,038
And one by one, everyone in the village

559
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,519
added an ingredient. And that's how a

560
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:40,400
man fed himself and saved himself some

561
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:43,519
from starvation and fed the rest of the

562
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,919
village at the same time.

563
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,519
That's how I look at recruiting.

564
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,840
where

565
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:52,639
people have a desire to achieve things

566
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,480
that are beyond their personal

567
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,159
capability

568
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,519
and if you can offer them the

569
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,679
opportunity to combine their ingredients

570
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,319
with others,

571
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,720
everyone can eat. I look at religions

572
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,439
like operating systems,

573
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,519
right? So if you look at Greek society

574
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,279
when they were young and less mature and

575
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,759
more agricultural

576
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:19,119
agriculturally driven they worship

577
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:21,038
Hestia the goddess of the earth and Zeus

578
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:25,119
but when they industrialized and

579
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,599
imperialized Athena and Aries took over.

580
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,599
M

581
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:32,558
and so to me it's the civilization and

582
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,839
the population that choose which god

583
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,079
they worship

584
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:37,519
the god of their own understanding which

585
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,720
is really the god of their own

586
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,960
incentives

587
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,679
so they don't realize it at the time

588
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,679
yep yep it's the same as the individual

589
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,360
as well the individual can kind of go

590
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,679
through a similar process in terms of

591
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:52,719
what they value

592
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:57,679
so comp said there are three stages uh

593
00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:01,200
we go through Um well we go from nature

594
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,400
worship to polytheism to monotheism to

595
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,360
metaphysics to science and philosophy.

596
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,960
Mhm.

597
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:13,918
And religion seldom survives philosophy

598
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,798
challenge is art is built on the

599
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:21,278
religion. So when you displace the

600
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:23,759
religion with science you lose the art

601
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,919
off of it.

602
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,319
So where does that leave us in terms of

603
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:33,120
western civilization?

604
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:36,158
So if you look at the cyclical nature of

605
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:39,038
things, says God is dead

606
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:42,240
and Young says yes, he dies every so

607
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:44,558
often or haven't you noticed?

608
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,278
And so this whole movement towards

609
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:49,519
touching grass and being one with nature

610
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:52,000
is a natural move from getting fed up

611
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:55,038
with the Iron Man Marvel movie and

612
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,640
scientism to going back to nature. But

613
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:00,640
then you also see the large conversion

614
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,120
of scienceism

615
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,400
to the Nation of Islam. We're going back

616
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,798
to Christianity.

617
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,720
Yeah.

618
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,158
Right. That's why Jordan Peterson is so

619
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,679
popular. Not because he's a great

620
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,840
debater, but because he's bringing back

621
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,640
the grandparents religion.

622
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:16,720
Yeah.

623
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,080
In a way that's a little more palatable.

624
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,440
Because when you're young, it's [ __ ]

625
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:24,558
you, [ __ ] off grandpa. Right. Yeah. What

626
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,320
happens when Lin Linus dies and he

627
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:29,319
leaves Linux? What do you think about

628
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:29,319
that?

629
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,480
Have you been

630
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,600
uh noticing the debates in the Linux

631
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:43,360
kernel email chat? So, take a look.

632
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:45,839
You'll see that Linus is beefing with

633
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:49,759
some of the community members right now.

634
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:52,319
Yeah. about um file system

635
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:55,679
upgrades to the Linux system.

636
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:58,558
Um there are a lot of people who do not

637
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,880
like what's happening in the political,

638
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,678
legal and regulatory market on the Linux

639
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,799
side in terms of capture in terms of

640
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:09,919
what Ubuntu is doing in terms of uh

641
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:12,400
these new terms of services.

642
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:16,480
Do we have to start a new Linux?

643
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,759
You are seeing people get uh a framer

644
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,000
laptop which is a modular laptop. Framer

645
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,640
remember they want to do modular phones.

646
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,480
Framer did a modular desktop and a

647
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,759
modular laptop that you can just turn

648
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,159
over, open up and just like the Fisher

649
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,919
Price replace the pieces as and when you

650
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,120
like including the screen.

651
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,880
Oo that's good.

652
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:42,639
They Yeah. So it's Framer and Linux. Um,

653
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,400
I think the the YouTuber PewDiePie is

654
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,360
really making Linux popular right now

655
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,159
because he said,

656
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,759
"Oh, nice."

657
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,919
Uh, [ __ ] all this running Linux.

658
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:54,720
And that started him down the rabbit

659
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:59,278
hole of trying to repatriate all of his

660
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,839
services and become his own self-hosted

661
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:04,000
solution provider.

662
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:07,119
So, brilliant. I'm definitely going to

663
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,240
do a deep dive on that one. Um the uh

664
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:13,839
who should I interview about this uh

665
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,759
this uh new uh division with Linux

666
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,480
Linux?

667
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:21,839
Oh man. Um

668
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:26,000
I would have to think I know actually an

669
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:29,439
interesting interview uh would be with

670
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,480
um Liinal Snake. Do you know

671
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,320
Liinal Snake?

672
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,120
I don't. Uh actually Brian was

673
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,158
introduced to me through Liinal Snake.

674
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,519
Okay, cool.

675
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,360
Liinal Snake uh he wrote the forward

676
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:46,480
when I wrote a book what I learned on X.

677
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:48,479
He wrote the forward. I asked him to um

678
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,319
and in the forward he writes X is a sea

679
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,278
of narcissists

680
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:56,000
and uh he told me that everyone has an

681
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:57,839
epistemic center but most people never

682
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,319
move theirs.

683
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:02,240
Whoa. Moving an epistemic center. That's

684
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,639
good. He said, "Everyone has an

685
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,519
epistemic center. Most people never move

686
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,520
theirs."

687
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,918
The other thing he told me is that if

688
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,558
God grants you the ability to turn a

689
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,919
curse into a blessing and wander the

690
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:19,200
land collecting curses,

691
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,919
he understands Linux. And so I he's at a

692
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,919
liinal snake.
