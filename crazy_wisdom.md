I will. Yeah. Genius. Genius. Uh, so thank you so much for coming on the show. How can our listeners more about you? Um, you know what? If the vibes are right, you'll find me. I'm out there. So, I think I I do think that uh the West is still far more innovative than than than um than China, but man, it's it's like so hard to to go go into the future and try to figure out like what does that mean? Is it neo feudalism? Is it just uh like a middle class with superpowers? Is it the sort of US spirit of the con constitution like farmer type of guy? Yeah, go for it. So, um, I think about Roman Carthage. So, when Rome encountered Carthage and vice versa, Rome didn't have a navy. Interesting. Right. Yeah. And yet, we know about Rome and we don't really have Carthage with us today, although it exists in New York. And if you look at how Rome conquered Carthage, it's by co-opting their innovation of boats of ships of the ships. Yes. And so Peter Teal, they asked Peter Teal about this on Uncommon Knowledge and he said the US is still ahead of China in terms of innovation. We used to be ahead 10 steps. Now we're only ahead two or three. And when you're only ahead by two or three steps, that's not the same scenario as your work. And so one of the other uh futures I see is not necessarily a changing of the guard. So I think I I do think that uh the West is still far more innovative than than than um than China. Um but um if you're only one or two steps ahead, that's not very much. And so if things are copied very quickly then maybe you don't need to innovate at all. You can um outsource all the very hard R&D work to um to the west. You have a lot of dead weight economic costs associated with that. And then if you can just steal all the IP it might that might even be you know a more efficient way to um to um innovate and you're maybe you're six months behind but um you don't have to be behind that far. For Budrear the apocalypse has already occurred. The apocalypse didn't come about because of a pandemic or a nuclear war. The apocalypse happened because humans ceased to be the sole reason of things and the machines took on a reasoning of their own. And so every time I work with AI, I feel like a traitor to Connor. Right. So Connor is doing chin-ups, you know, down the hall trying to prevent AI, you know, I'm over here. Hey, you want to clone yourself? Yeah. You know, I I think about it, but I also think about that that spec specific sci-fi popularity from the 60s to the 90s was a reaction to nuclear power. Uh, and you know, Godzilla. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Godzilla. Interesting. I haven't thought about Godzilla in that. I think Godzilla is is supposed to be nuclear war. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Radiation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For Bodriard, the apocalypse has already occurred. It wasn't religious or anything. It was not atomic bombs. At some point in the development of technology, human beings ceased to be the reason of things and things took on their own reasons, technological things. I'm also reading a book. Uh, it's called The Money Market by William Behot. Wow. Okay, I got to write that down. The money Oh, man. Karma Coverage gave me this book from Dark Labs. It's The Money Market by William Behot. It's written maybe 150 years ago and it describes how the London money market came to rule European finance and it's about how by becoming experts at lending large sums of capital large sums that weren't available in industrializing economies, right? that they could take that they were the only place a country could come to to build a railway for example because in the countries they didn't have enough coordination or consensus around how capital is loaned out and so everyone had to come to London because they knew that they could get their debt priced you know New York just had their election Yeah. Oh, interesting. Yeah. And um one of the things about New York is they kind of got the short end of the stick of the Donald Trump Inquisition. Go explain that. What is I don't I'm not familiar there. Sure. So, like it's the New York attorney general that wanted to prosecute Donald Trump, right? So if you look at the relationship between the current administration, New York strain ties. Now the other thing you're going to like uh the ascent of money, the money market. Have you ever heard of the TXS? No. You're going to like this. TXSE is the Texas Stock Exchange. I didn't hear about this. Yeah. Interesting. that it's a joint venture between Citadel and Black Rockck about a buck 25 125 million about a couple years ago very quietly it's in the news but you know very quietly they said all right you know what my my pet theory is that the uh wealth from the the southern states want a bit more control over the political legal and regulatory environment of their equity debt positions. Well, what do I want to know? Uh uh so okay, so the wealth the the the stories because it's almost like a a return of of the south uh after 150 years. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh which I kind of like uh not so Mexico the south is trying to take uh control of the north again. I chaos always seems to just uh wipe the board clean. Uh, and people who think they have a lot of power essentially lose a lot of power as well. Any thoughts there? So, I think of two things. I had to write them down. Um, I think about paper clips and I think about um the theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism. Oo, interesting. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So um the theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism uh is a book hidden within 1984. Oh great. Right. And so by Goldstein, Emanuel Goldstein and he says he basically pauses that the nature of most industries is consolidation. When uh beer, diamonds, you uranium, you name it. Um as industries mature, money markets, food even, right? Um these to be efficient, a market consolidates, and large players emerge, right? And so part of me feels that if it is true that the nature as civilizations mature is that their industries oligarchize right where there's natural oligopul that's almost driven by economies of scale then if it's true that a cottage industry will naturally emerge no matter where you are um then conspiracies are likely to ensue from that and those will be true because once you have a cottage industry monopoly right yes exactly a a co- monopoly a syndicate a shosa a caretsu mitsubishi three diamonds three industries right syndicates form uh as a result of a stone soup they can't have a meal without adding ingredients together. They can't make a meal alone. Entropy, native entropy. Interesting. Yeah. And the nature to further drive profits. And so I when I mentioned the paper clips, I think that you know the criticism of AI and any computer kind of uh driven system is that eventually it'll allocate all resources against human desires. Oh, right. And so when I look at these oligarchies and these civilizations, um the way that civilizations expand is by turning other nations into their paper clip makers to give leisure to their population. Well, okay. Well, that yes, so in the industrial age, leisure to the bgeoisi and the proletariat. Um uh now we seem to be into another strange place of history where it seems to be messing up. Yeah, go for it. I would love to hear what you think. But the burgeois, everyone in North America is the burgeois compared to the rest of the world. Y right. And I don't think the part that I still wrestle with in my mind is that um you know leisure comes out of imperial conquest in that way, right? the the American leisure system AC and the internet and all is only a factor of their power of the oligarchic system. Yeah. And the fact that everyone was rebuilding for the past hundred years while we were proliferating. Yeah. Interesting. This is uh very interesting territory. So the leisure because because it is the aristocracy and we're going into neofudalism. Do well actually a good question for you. Do you think that the middle class is on its way out? Do you think the middle class is going to survive this? What do you think? Um, I think everything we're experiencing from a technology perspective has the ability to achieve both the 10,000 beautiful visions and the 10,000 horrible visions. Yeah, I agree. And so the more I see the power of technology, I'm like, wow, do you realize the power of a single individual? Yep. And that's and this government is saying, oh shit, did you see the power of the single individual? Right. Yeah. You know, I think the because they've been playing out an opportunity for a liquidity exit. That's Bitcoin. That's where Bitcoin comes in. Well, there is no Bitcoin without inflation. Yeah. Right. And so, uh, at the same time, uh, when is an exit simply another trap? A lot of a lot of my friends call Bitcoin quantitative decentralization. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Digital currency doesn't just allow for decentralization. If you look at the theory of oligarchical collectivism and the natural cottage monopolies or industries or oligopodies or soosas that emerge, a lot of people are looking at the consolidation in the market and saying Bitcoin might be the source and acceleration of a neoalism. Yep. Yep. And I can see that argument. Yep. It's only volatile if you watch it every day. 7 billion 7 trillion. A trillion for Vangar. Yeah. He um wrote a thesis at Princeton in the 50s. Wow. On the fact that a lot of these hedge funds were lying to people and masquerading their ability to produce returns that only make money for them. Yeah. And so he wrote the index thesis called the index fund and Vanguard hired him, implemented the thesis and literally made $7 trillion by knowing that they could not time the market which is what they what they say in finance they or the finance classes. My friend used to tell me that that's what he learned is like information asymmetry. Uh you just unless you're an insider you don't have the information to make the short-term trades. There's all these like arbitrage quantitative things that you can do with a computer. But it turns out that the only way these really fancy people can outperform the market is by transferring their losses onto the taxpayers during a bailout. The socialization of risk uh which is the whole reason our this was just so crazy that 2008 happened. Uh, I've been in the ascent of money. Continues to happen. It continues to happen. There's no there's no there's no one went to jail in 2008. Uh, look what happened with Robin Hood. Robin Hood to me was like a soft bailout because it prevented people from going belly up during GameStop. They halted trading. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. And I was like, whoa, they're now doing micro bailouts. This is nuts. Because I think capitalism and communism have done a good job for the population on planet Earth as balancing forces. Oh, interesting. Right. Collectivism and individualism working together side by side, you know. Um, and so, you know, if you look at the operating system of the west, it does drive innovation. Yeah. If you look at the operating system of the east right it drives um uh commercializ in terms of like industrial commercialization let's say right and so if we can maintain that balance that would be great but whether AI is a at present a symbiate but in the long run a parasite I can see those futures. Mhm. When when does the parasite become the host? Oh, so I was just thinking about this as I uh recklessly uh put cloud code on my computer. I already did cloud on my computer a while ago. Awesome. Yeah. uh cloud code and cloud desktop uh on my computer and I try to limit it but you know given this um the what claude an enthropic released and I think chat openai also released something similar about their papers of so if you look at what's happening with Jim Keller and his startup tens torrent Jim Keller built everyone ships cool ke l e r look him up what's his name ten Torrent. Okay. And so AMD, Intel, Tesla, Apple, that's Jim Keller's chips. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. He started his own company. Yeah. When he had a disagreement with the guy who's no longer there at Intel, right? Wow. And so he started his own company and they're uh to the individual power side. Uh Nvidia has a strangle hold uh on the market through their CUDA environment for programming. Yeah. Which Jim and everyone at R R Ic5 Risk 5 which is the idea of open- source hardware. Nice. Okay. Right. Yeah. Is to completely and that's same thing with Mojo. They want to disrupt the Nvidia Jensen hegemony. And so this is where I see again those shifting powers because the scale is coming to the edge, that power that used to just be um monopolized is coming to the edge. And if you look at exponential organizations that are achieving billion dollar valuations with less than 12 disciples, right, you don't need that many people to agree with you to make a big impact. Yeah. Look at clearly. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Okay. Exponential organizations. Uh do you know are there books there about Yes. Yeah. So, um, you ever heard of Price's law? No. Price's law, it's a kind of it's the idea that basically fuels recruiting. The square root of the number of people in an industry do 50% of the work, right? Now there's debates about whether it's accurate and how much but I think we all have kind of you know an instinct that if you have 10 people in the room one person is doing most of the work or haven't you not experienced that working in small teams before right and so um exponential organizations leverages this fact by saying if it is true that the square root of the number of people in an industry do 50% of the work. Now that we have open- source hardware and AI and all of these things to operate as if we were operating at scale, then how do we achieve a billion dollar valuation with under less than 12 people? That's what exponential organizations. Okay, great. And any books that go into that specific one? Yes, there's a book by um Saleem Ishmael who was a a seasoned you know startup and venture executive. He has numerous books and you'll see an infographic that talks about the eight elements of exponential organizations. Okay, great. That's for me to go find that. Um given all those efficiencies, why doesn't one company own everything? Um and and yeah, because they treat the talent bad once they get to that size though, right? Because there's no choice not to. If it's one thing that corporations do extremely well, it's keep recruiters employed because they constantly treat the prices love people like shit. Yeah. And eventually, right, they they either I reach out to them or someone like me calls them and says, "Hi, my name is Michael. We haven't spoken before. Let me take some of the mystery out of my call." And I talk to them about an opportunity that, you know, I don't want to break up a happy home, but Yeah. You know, would you be open? Yeah. Yeah. Right. Oh, you would be. Oh, you need to close your door. I'll wait. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. I don't I've now figured out I definitely don't never want to work in an organization larger than 150 people. Um like non-starter for me. I never want to do that again. Um and thinking about my own future business and this 12 number feels like a really good number uh to to focus on. Um even 12 was too much for Jesus. Sorry. Uh let's go down that path. Uh, okay. Yeah. Even Wait, because of Judas. There's a Judas in every age. Judas. That's not me. That's Wilhelm Reich. The murder of Christ. Wilhelm Reich. Watch out for that guy cuz he had his books burned. Wilhelm Reich. The murder of Christ. What? That's the book. Okay. Christ was not crucified. He was murdered. Understand the difference. There was a Judas in every age. Oh man, I'm not a Python developer, but I can get Python code and I can copy and paste that into a box that runs it. Yeah, that runs it. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Uh uh a guy who started a nuclear company told me this story and laughed. A man is starving. He starts begging for food. Nobody gives him food. So he goes to another village and starts begging for food. Nobody gives him food. With his last energy, he goes to a third village. And this time he switches up his strategy. He finds a big cauldron, fills it with water, puts a fire underneath the cauldron, starts boiling the water. Then he finds a large stone and puts a stone at the bottom of the cauldron. By this time, a woman and her son noticed what's happening and she asked the man, "Hey, what are you doing?" And he goes, "I'm making a stone soup." And she goes, "Oh, that sounds delicious. Can I have some?" And he goes, "Sure, just add an ingredient." And one by one, everyone in the village added an ingredient. And that's how a man fed himself and saved himself some from starvation and fed the rest of the village at the same time. That's how I look at recruiting. where people have a desire to achieve things that are beyond their personal capability and if you can offer them the opportunity to combine their ingredients with others, everyone can eat. I look at religions like operating systems, right? So if you look at Greek society when they were young and less mature and more agricultural agriculturally driven they worship Hestia the goddess of the earth and Zeus but when they industrialized and imperialized Athena and Aries took over. M and so to me it's the civilization and the population that choose which god they worship the god of their own understanding which is really the god of their own incentives so they don't realize it at the time yep yep it's the same as the individual as well the individual can kind of go through a similar process in terms of what they value so comp said there are three stages uh we go through Um well we go from nature worship to polytheism to monotheism to metaphysics to science and philosophy. Mhm. And religion seldom survives philosophy challenge is art is built on the religion. So when you displace the religion with science you lose the art off of it. So where does that leave us in terms of western civilization? So if you look at the cyclical nature of things, says God is dead and Young says yes, he dies every so often or haven't you noticed? And so this whole movement towards touching grass and being one with nature is a natural move from getting fed up with the Iron Man Marvel movie and scientism to going back to nature. But then you also see the large conversion of scienceism to the Nation of Islam. We're going back to Christianity. Yeah. Right. That's why Jordan Peterson is so popular. Not because he's a great debater, but because he's bringing back the grandparents religion. Yeah. In a way that's a little more palatable. Because when you're young, it's fuck you, fuck off grandpa. Right. Yeah. What happens when Lin Linus dies and he leaves Linux? What do you think about that? Have you been uh noticing the debates in the Linux kernel email chat? So, take a look. You'll see that Linus is beefing with some of the community members right now. Yeah. about um file system upgrades to the Linux system. Um there are a lot of people who do not like what's happening in the political, legal and regulatory market on the Linux side in terms of capture in terms of what Ubuntu is doing in terms of uh these new terms of services. Do we have to start a new Linux? You are seeing people get uh a framer laptop which is a modular laptop. Framer remember they want to do modular phones. Framer did a modular desktop and a modular laptop that you can just turn over, open up and just like the Fisher Price replace the pieces as and when you like including the screen. Oo that's good. They Yeah. So it's Framer and Linux. Um, I think the the YouTuber PewDiePie is really making Linux popular right now because he said, "Oh, nice." Uh, fuck all this running Linux. And that started him down the rabbit hole of trying to repatriate all of his services and become his own self-hosted solution provider. So, brilliant. I'm definitely going to do a deep dive on that one. Um the uh who should I interview about this uh this uh new uh division with Linux Linux? Oh man. Um I would have to think I know actually an interesting interview uh would be with um Liinal Snake. Do you know Liinal Snake? I don't. Uh actually Brian was introduced to me through Liinal Snake. Okay, cool. Liinal Snake uh he wrote the forward when I wrote a book what I learned on X. He wrote the forward. I asked him to um and in the forward he writes X is a sea of narcissists and uh he told me that everyone has an epistemic center but most people never move theirs. Whoa. Moving an epistemic center. That's good. He said, "Everyone has an epistemic center. Most people never move theirs." The other thing he told me is that if God grants you the ability to turn a curse into a blessing and wander the land collecting curses, he understands Linux. And so I he's at a liinal snake.
